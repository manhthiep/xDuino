Freeduino is a collaborative open-source project to replicate and publish Arduino-compatible hardware files. The Freeduino Eagle SCH, BRD and Gerber production files allow users to create boards that are 100% functionally, electrically and physically compatible with Arduino hardware.

While Arduino is a protected trademark, Freeduino comes with a free and unrestricted license to use the Freeduino name, available for any use. This means you can do whatever you want with these files. The idea here is to make available the Eagle files you would need to make your own Freeduino variant board.

Freeduino currently consists of a Diecimilia-equivalent schematic and 0603, 0805, 1206 and through-hole routed board files. In addidtion, we have begun posting files derived from by others from the first Freeduino files (yes, Arduino>Freeduino>others!). 


V1.16	
--------
Complete package: Eagle PCB files and Gerber files for the 0603, 0805, 1206 and TH prototype run version 1.16. 
These designs have been confirmed working. These are all the files you would need to build one or 1000 Arduino-compatible Freeduino boards.
Final design files for version 1.16 only.

V1.15	
--------
0603 surface-mount version .sch and routed .brd files: freeduino_V1.15-WestfW-0603-070912.zip in zipped Eagle format. Posted September 15th, 2007
 	
1206 surface-mount .sch and .brd files: freeduino_V1.15-WestfW-1206-070915.zip in zipped Eagle format. Posted September 15th, 2007
 	
Through-hole component version .sch, and .brd files: pre-freeduino_nkc_thru-hole.zip in zipped Eagle format. This is actually a modification of the Arduino 2.1 USB design, made to be Diecimilia compatible and branded with the Freeduino name. Available as a kit with instructions. Posted September 15th, 2007

(We Forked things here, from schematic only to schematic & 0603/ 1206 board routes.)

V1.13	
--------
Freeduino .sch and .brd files: v 1.13 in zipped Eagle format. Fixed fuse-ground short. September 4th, 2007.

V1.12	
--------
Freeduino .sch and .brd files: v 1.12 in zipped Eagle format. Now includes board file with mostly SMT 0603 parts.Posted September 4th, 2007.

V1.11	
--------
Freeduino Schematic: v 1.11 in zipped Eagle format. Fixed RX/TX leds.Posted August 30, 2007.

V1.1	
--------
Freeduino Schematic version 1.1: this is the schematic only, in zipped Eagle format.
