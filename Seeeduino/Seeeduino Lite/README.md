Seeeduino Lite
======

Seeeduino Lite is a microcontroller based on ATmega32U4. Just like Arduino Leonardo, it saves a secondary processor needed for USB to serial communication. And this allows Seeeduino Lite appear to computer as a USB device, like keyboard and mouse. 

Derived from Leonardo, we also merged custom details of Seeeduino series into Seeeduino Lite, like selectable operating voltage, onboard Grove connectors and so on. It has 20 digital I/Os (7 of which can output PWM),a micro USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter to get started.
