======

Seeeduino Mega is a powerful microcontroller derived from Arduino Mega. It features ATmega2560 processor which brings a 
large number of I/O pins, as much as 70 digital I/O, 16 analog inputs, 14 PWM, and 4 hardware serial ports. 

Compared to Arduino Mega, we shrunk the volume of Arduino Mega by at least 30% and made it 100% compatible with Seeed 
Shield products. And as a member of Seeeduino series, Seeeduino Mega inherits deliberate details from Seeeduino, like 
selectable operating voltage (3.3V/5V), right angle reset button, and so on.
