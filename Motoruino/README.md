The Motoruino is a board based on the Arduino platform, it is designed to work with motors, servos and sensors.

Motoruino most important features:
- easy to use, understand, play with
- plug-and-roll board
- compatible with Arduino Diecimilla/Duemillanove and Shields
- one H-Bridge (L293D) allows you to control 2 dc motors
- the usage of the H-Bridge is open, i.e., there arenâ€™t any Arduino output pins assigned, - the user can use the H-Bridge the way he/she wants
- two jumpers allow the motors power supply and the PWM pins to be either connected to the external supply (Vin) or regulated 5 volts
- motors have 3 different connectors, screw terminals, male headers, JST connectors
- servos and sensors can be easily plugged in due to dedicated power and ground headers on each pin
- two possible FTDI/USB connections available:USB / TTL convertor, there are some choices on the market for this one, you can have it in the form of a cable, or in the form of a small pcb or using a USB adaptor with the FTDI chip embedded.
